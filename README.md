Cleaning and extraction of USPTO data from ORD

The scripts herein will extract and clean USPTO data from ORD with various manual steps relying on chemical domain knowledge. This results in an open-source dataset containing a mapped reaction, reactants, products, solvents, reagents, catalysts, and yields in a pandas DataFrame structure that should also be easily usable by people with little knowledge of chemistry.
